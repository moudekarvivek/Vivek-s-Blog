## üå±Git Stash

Git stash is a command that allows you to temporarily save changes you have made in your working directory, without committing them. This is useful when you need to switch to a different branch to work on something else, but you don't want to commit the changes you've made in your current branch yet.

Example of how `git stash` works:

Suppose you're working on a branch let's say ***feature*** in your Git repository and you've made changes to your files but you're not ready to commit them because you want to switch to another branch to fix a bug.

1. To stash your changes
    
    ```plaintext
    git stash
    ```
    
    This will stash your changes, and gets your working directory clean.
    
2. You can switch to another branch now using `git checkout`:
    
    ```plaintext
    git checkout <Next_Branch_name>
    ```
    
3. After working on the other branch, you then decided to come back to your previous changes. To retrieve your changes from the stash, you can use:
    
    ```plaintext
    git stash pop
    ```
    
    This is a basic example of how `git stash` can be used to temporarily store changes in Git. It's very flexible when you need to switch work.
    

# üå±Git Cherry-pick

Git cherry-pick is a command that allows you to select specific commits from one branch and apply them to another. This can be useful when you want to selectively apply changes that were made in one branch to another.

**Example:**

1. Create 2 Branches
    
    ```plaintext
     git checkout -b devops
     # Make changes and commits on devops branch
     git commit -m "Commit 1 on devops"
     git commit -m "Commit 2 on devops"
    ```
    
    ```plaintext
     git checkout -b feature
     # Make changes and commits on feature branch
     git commit -m "Commit 1 on feature"
     git commit -m "Commit 2 on feature"
    ```
    
2. Now, apply "Commit 2 of `devops` branch" to `feature` branch
    
    find the commit hash code of "Commit 2 on devops":
    
    ```plaintext
    git log --oneline 
    #log command show all the commits with hash ID
    ```
    
3. Switch to feature branch now:
    
    ```plaintext
     git checkout feature
    ```
    
4. Cherry-pick the commit from `devops` branch:
    
    ```plaintext
     git cherry-pick <commit_hash_ID>
    ```
    
5. Resolve conflicts You'll need to manually resolve these conflicts, stage the changes, and continue the cherry-pick with `git cherry-pick --continue`.
    
6. Once conflicts are resolved (if any), the commit from `devops` will be cherry-picked onto `feature`.
    

# **üå±Conclusion**

In summary, `git stash` is for temporarily storing changes at backstage, while `git cherry-pick` is for selectively applying specific commits to another branch. Both commands are valuable tools in managing your Git workflow efficiently.
